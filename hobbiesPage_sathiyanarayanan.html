                <p class="text"><strong>Ramya's Bharatanatyam dance school teaches this traditional dance form to students of all ages and backgrounds. She is passionate about preserving and sharing this art form. She offers a structured curriculum that includes training in dance techniques, music, and performance. Students will typically start with the basics, learning the various steps, postures, and hand gestures (mudras) that are used in Bharatanatyam. As they progress, they will learn more complex dance sequences and choreography, as well as the use of facial expressions and storytelling in their performances. In addition to dance training, she also offers classes in music, including vocal and instrumental training. This is because Bharatanatyam dance is often performed to classical Indian music, and dancers need to have a good understanding of rhythm and melody in order to perform effectively.</strong></p>
